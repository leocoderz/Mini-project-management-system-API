# üìò Project Management API

A simple **RESTful Project Management System** built with **Django Rest Framework**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**.  
Supports **user authentication**, **role-based permissions** (Admin, Project Manager, Developer), **project/task management**, and **Swagger API documentation**.

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- **Authentication:** JWT (SimpleJWT)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **API Documentation:** Swagger / OpenAPI (drf-yasg)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-management-api.git
cd project-management-api
```

2. **Create `.env` (optional)**  
*(If you want separate environment variables)*

3. **Build and start using Docker**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

4. **Access the application**
- API root: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
- Admin panel: [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/)
- Swagger API docs: [http://localhost:8000/swagger/](http://localhost:8000/swagger/)

5. **Create a Django superuser**

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

‚úÖ You're ready to go!

## üèó Architecture Decisions (Brief)

- **Django Rest Framework** was selected for its simplicity and power in building APIs rapidly.
- **Role-based Access Control** is implemented using Django Groups (Admin, Project Manager, Developer).
- **PostgreSQL** chosen over SQLite for better production-readiness and Docker compatibility.
- **Docker** is used for containerized development and easy deployment (web app + database).
- **Swagger (drf-yasg)** provides interactive API documentation for developers and testers.
- The home page is dynamically rendered based on user login state for better UX.

---

## üìú API Main Features

- **User Registration/Login** (JWT Tokens)
- **Project Management** (CRUD)
- **Task Management** (CRUD with priorities, deadlines, status)
- **Filtering Tasks** by project, status, or due date
- **Role Based Permissions**:
  - Admin & Project Manager: Full access
  - Developer: Read-only access
